adding objects to scene:
	need to pick from vertex/fragment shader? No - assume everything has normals. Choose from fragment shaders. 
	maybe choose from a list of shaders? like globals? 
	
add object should be simple hopefully. 


implement undo/redo adding objects/lights.

implement arena memory allocation instead of new/delete (should actually be easy)
