TODOz::
add editor command class to abstract "editor" adding/removing lights, objects etc. 
with undo thingy; save like previous shit and do it yknow.
array/vector of EditorCommands in Scene maybe - just like point to that shit (iterator? yuck)

redo light class : i think inheritance easier to understand here - light : public spotlight etc, then can store pointers of lights 
in the editor command - easy to push back and etc ok ? ok
